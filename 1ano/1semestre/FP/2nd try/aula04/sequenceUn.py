This program generates 20 terms of a sequence by a recurrence relation.
Change it to show all positive terms of the sequence and count them.
Format the columns to make the output look like this:
   n        Un
   0   100.000
   1    99.990
   2    99.980

while Un>=0:
    print(n, Un)
    Un = 1.01*Un - 1.01     # Set Un to the next term of the sequence
